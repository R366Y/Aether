Ray tracer written in Julia

This ray tracer is based on the book **The Ray Tracer Challenge** written by *Jamis Buck* [http://raytracerchallenge.com/].

The purpose of this project is twofold:
1. Create a ray tracer, I always wanted to develop a computer graphics project  
2. Learn a new programming language, i chose Julia because it promise speed without the strain of using a languange like C++
